📊 Telecom Customers Dashboard – Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of telecom customer behavior with a strong focus on churn, tenure, charges, contracts, and payment methods. It helps stakeholders understand customer retention patterns and revenue distribution for better business decisions.

🔍 Key Insights

Customer Churn Analysis
The dashboard clearly compares customers who have churned (Yes) versus retained (No). Non-churn customers contribute significantly higher total tenure and monthly charges, indicating long-term value.

Tenure & Online Security
Customers with Online Security enabled show higher cumulative tenure, while customers without internet services or security have comparatively lower engagement.

Revenue Overview
The gauge chart highlights the total charges (≈456K), offering a quick snapshot of overall revenue generated from customers.

Contract Type Impact
Month-to-month contracts have a higher churn rate compared to one-year and two-year contracts, which show better customer retention and stable monthly revenue.

Senior Citizen Analysis
The KPI card shows the total number of senior citizens, and the payment method chart reveals that most senior citizens prefer Electronic Check, followed by Bank Transfer and Credit Card (Auto Pay).

Payment Methods
Electronic check is the most commonly used payment method, which also correlates with higher churn risk compared to automated payment options.
